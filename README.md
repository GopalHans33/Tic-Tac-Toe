## Usage
1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start the game.
2. Players take turns clicking on the buttons to mark their moves with 'X' or 'O'.
3. In user vs. computer mode, the computer will automatically make its move after the player.
4. The game will automatically check for a winner or a draw after each move.
5. Click the "Reset" button to start a new game.

## Game Rules
1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
2. Player 1 is 'X' and Player 2 (or the computer) is 'O'. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
4. If all 9 squares are full and neither player has 3 in a row, the game is declared a draw.
